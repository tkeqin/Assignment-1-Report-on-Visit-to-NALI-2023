During my visit to NALI 2023 on 8 November, I got the opportunity to visit a lot of booths that cover a wide range of knowledge such as employment, app development, environment, education, services, business, robotics, innovation and so on. I get to broaden my perspective and be open to new ideas. I get to know better in these areas by visiting the booth and asking questions to the professional presenters. The explanation from the presenters is clear and detailed. The presenters are friendly and approachable. They answered all my questions patiently and professionally. Besides, the poster from every booth is eye-catching and well-structured as it summarized the key points or topics they wished to express. 

However, there are some improvement areas that the organizer of NALI 2023 can work on. Firstly, the spacing between booths was tight which causes disruptions when presenters engaged with visitors. Next, during my visit to NALI 2023, I encountered some booths where presenters were unavailable which means I am not able to approach the presenter for further explanation. 

Overall, my NALI 2023 experience was highly enriching. It shifted my perspective and fuelled my desire to participate in diverse projects that will equip me to join NALI as a presenter in the future.
